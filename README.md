## AnomaData-PredictiveMaintenance
## Project Overview
AnomaData: Automated Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance is a project aimed at predicting machine breakdowns by identifying anomalies in equipment data. This is crucial for various industries that rely on predictive maintenance to reduce risks and gain actionable insights from their machinery data. The dataset comprises over 18,000 rows collected over several days, with the target variable 'y' indicating anomalies (1 for anomaly, 0 for normal).

## Key Features
 *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: 
  Detailed analysis to understand data patterns, relationships, and trends.

 Data Cleaning: 
  Standardization, handling missing values, and outliers.

 Feature Engineering: 
  Creating and transforming features for better model performance.

 Model Training and Validation: 
  Implementing various machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
